# Tricky Interview Questions

## Tell me a little about your background / your research / a side project.

### What makes this question hard?

## What is your experience with machine learning?

### What makes this question hard?

PeFellows tend to undersell their experiences and start off on the wrong foot.


## What experience do you have with X? (When X is something that you haven’t worked with before.)

### What makes this question hard?
You want to be honest but declaring that you know nothing about X shuts the conversation down.

### So what should you do?

-   Avoid declaring a complete lack of knowledge: “I’ve never worked with X. [pause for next question]”
    
-   Instead, draw your connection to X: “While I haven’t applied X before, I was considering using that method for my Insight project/ a similar method in my academic research.”
    
-   Get more context on why X is important for the company: “Do you, as a data scientist at company Y, apply X to your consumer behavior experiments?”
    
-   Start a conversation about how X could be useful for the company or your projects: “I can see how X could be the most effective method for reducing latency in your model but it tends to be less accurate than method Z. How do you weigh latency versus accuracy in this context?”
