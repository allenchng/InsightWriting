# Tricky Interview Questions

cowritten with Emily Kearney

## Tell me a little about your background / your research / a side project.

### What makes this question hard?

It’s half-technical, half-behavioral.

### So what should you do?



## What is your experience with machine learning?

### What makes this question hard?

People tend to fail at this question in one of two ways. One, they undersell their experiences and start off on the wrong foot. This is a classic form of imposter syndrome. Second, they dive too deeply into projects and overwhelm the interviewer with too much information. This can make you come across as a poor communicator. 

### So what should you do?

-   You have experience in ML, state so:  “I’ve worked with machine learning in multiple instances.”
    
-   Start high level: “In my research, I used a variety of statistical learning techniques to understand how brain activity is related to individual differences in human learning. As a data science intern for an advertising technology company, I built classification models to determine which users were mostly likely to convert on digital display ads. At Insight, my project utilized probabilistic time series approaches to forecast sneaker sales for an online resale marketplace.
    
Pass the conversation back to the interviewer: “I’m happy to go in more depth on any of these projects.”


## What experience do you have with X? (When X is something that you haven’t worked with before.)

### What makes this question hard?
You want to be honest but declaring that you know nothing about X shuts the conversation down.

### So what should you do?

-   Avoid declaring a complete lack of knowledge: “I’ve never worked with X. [pause for next question]”
    
-   Instead, draw your connection to X: “While I haven’t applied X before, I was considering using that method for my Insight project/ a similar method in my academic research.”
    
-   Get more context on why X is important for the company: “Do you, as a data scientist at company Y, apply X to your consumer behavior experiments?”
    
-   Start a conversation about how X could be useful for the company or your projects: “I can see how X could be the most effective method for reducing latency in your model but it tends to be less accurate than method Z. How do you weigh latency versus accuracy in this context?”
