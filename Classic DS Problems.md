# Data Science Problems in the Real World

## Why does this document exist?

At Insight, we like to talk about the role of context. Many people leaving careers in academia understand the technical details of statistics or machine learning, but what they don't have is the context for how these ideas are applied. The purpose of this document is to keep a running list of articles / videos to build context for how machine learning is applied across many different industries and many different problems.

This is a living document that is periodically updated. Please consider it a work in progress!

## Classification

Predicting classes or labels has multiple applications across industries.

## Visual Search 

Keywords often do not do a good job describing features of images. In these situations, visual search can help capture latent features that words do not identify.

#### Industry examples

- [Pinterest - Visual Search at Pinterest](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2783258.2788621)

- [eBay - An Easier Way to Search eBay: Computer Vision with Find It On eBay and Image Search Is Now Live](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/an-easier-way-to-search-ebay-computer-vision-with-find-it-on-ebay-and-image-search-is-now-live/)
---

## Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems are the the technology that powers the selection of movies you see when you open Netflix or when Amazon suggests products to purchase.

#### Industry Examples
- [The New York Times - How The New York Times is Experimenting with Recommendation Algorithms](https://open.nytimes.com/how-the-new-york-times-is-experimenting-with-recommendation-algorithms-562f78624d26)

- [Wayfair - Product Recommendations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JST1FyQOmWs&list=PLlkEXA5QpKRqrkbQP1pcfzsIxMsaI-0ZB&index=14)

- [eBay - How eBay is Advancing New Shopping, Browsing Models](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/how-ebay-is-advancing-new-shopping-browsing-models/)

## Text Search Systems

Text search systems are ubiquitous in our lives. The challenge of finding what users want using keywords or expressions, however, is a deep field whose problems vary across domain.

#### Industry Examples
- [Amazon - Building an NLP-powered search index with Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/building-an-nlp-powered-search-index-with-amazon-textract-and-amazon-comprehend/)

## Experimentation

Experimentation approaches are used commonly to improve products and their features. A/B testing is a form of experimentation that is commonly used with data science.

#### Industry Examples
- [Wayfair - Modeling Uplift Directly: Uplift Decision Tree with KL Divergence and Euclidean Distance as Splitting Criteria](https://tech.wayfair.com/data-science/2019/10/modeling-uplift-directly-uplift-decision-tree-with-kl-divergence-and-euclidean-distance-as-splitting-criteria/)

- [Uber - Mediation Modeling at Uber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2LxEYEs4Cg&list=PLLEUtp5eGr7BGZmX9Nrk4JYISPo_0nVOr&index=8)

## Churn Prediction

Churn is when users leave your product or service. Understanding who is likely to leave your service is important for retargeting, as the cost of customer acquisition is typically much higher than the cost of customer retention.

#### Industry Examples

- [Klaviyo - Predicting churn risk our new model](https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/predicting-churn-risk-our-new-model)
