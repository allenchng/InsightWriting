# Data Science Problems in the Real World

Maintained by Allen Chang

## Why does this document exist?

At Insight, we like to talk about the role of context. Many people leaving careers in academia understand the technical details of statistics or machine learning, but what they don't have is the context for how these ideas are applied. The purpose of this document is to keep a running list of articles / videos to build context for how machine learning is applied across many different industries and many different problems.

This is a living document that is periodically updated. Please consider it a work in progress!

## Classification

## Fraud and Anomaly Detection

Fraud detection is an approach to identify malicious and ill-intentioned transactions with a system. Similarly, anomaly detection is an approach used to identify unusual patterns in data.

## Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.

## Churn Prediction

Churn is when users leave your product or service. Understanding who is likely to leave your service is important for retargeting, as the cost of customer acquisition is typically much higher than the cost of customer retention.
