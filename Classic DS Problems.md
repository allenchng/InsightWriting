- [Wayfair - Measuring Price Effects](https://youtu.be/F7k-IqgxRcw?list=PLlkEXA5QpKRqrkbQP1pcfzsIxMsaI-0ZB)


## Text summarization

Extracting structure from unstructured text data.

#### Industry Examples

## Visual Search 

Keywords often do not do a good job describing features of images. In these situations, visual search is a necessary process.

#### Industry examples

- [Pinterest - Visual Search at Pinterest](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2783258.2788621)

## Search Systems

Finding what you want with words.

**Industry Examples**
- [Amazon - Building an NLP-powered search index with Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/building-an-nlp-powered-search-index-with-amazon-textract-and-amazon-comprehend/)
- [eBay - At eBay, Machine Learning is Driving Innovative New Approaches to Search Experiences](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/at-ebay-machine-learning-is-driving-innovative-new-approaches-to-search-experiences/)

## Time series forecasting

Forecasting involves using historical data to estimate future events. 

#### Industry Examples

## Organizational networks

### Insight projects

## Churn prediction

Churn is when users leave your product or service. Understanding who is likely to leave your service is important for retargeting, as the cost of customer acquisition is typically much higher than the cost of customer retention.

### Industry Examples
