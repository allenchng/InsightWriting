---

## Recommendation systems

The technology that powers the movies you see when you open Netflix or when Amazon suggests products to purchase.

**Industry Examples**

## Time series forecasting

Forecasting involves using historical data to estimate future events. 

#### Industry Examples

- [Uber - Forecasting at Uber: An Introduction](https://eng.uber.com/forecasting-introduction/)

- [Twitter- Do more with Twitter data: Evaluating time series and identifying trends](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2018/evaluating-time-series-and-identifying-trends.html)
---

## Customer segmentation

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.

#### Industry examples

- [MediaMath - Human-Readable Categorization of URLs/Apps](https://data-science-mediamath.ghost.io/human-readable-categorization-of-urls-apps/)

- [Twitter - Understanding-the-people-behind-the-Tweet](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2018/understanding-the-people-behind-the-Tweet.html)

## Survival analysis

Survival analysis measures the time until an event occurs.

## Experimentation

- [Wayfair - Modeling Uplift Directly: Uplift Decision Tree with KL Divergence and Euclidean Distance as Splitting Criteria](https://tech.wayfair.com/data-science/2019/10/modeling-uplift-directly-uplift-decision-tree-with-kl-divergence-and-euclidean-distance-as-splitting-criteria/)

## Churn prediction

Churn is when users leave your product or service. Understanding who is likely to leave your service is important for retargeting, as the cost of customer acquisition is typically much higher than the cost of customer retention.

### Industry Examples
